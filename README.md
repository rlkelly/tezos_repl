# tezos_repl
a repl for michelson, tezos smart contract language

This is just a simple repl in python to interact with a michelson stack machine.  This will allow experimentation, and as it matures you should be able to define multiple contracts and have them interact.


### TODO:

    - Parser for indentation
    - Map/Set Operations
    - BigMap in storage
    - Contract Functions
    - Add other Datatypes
